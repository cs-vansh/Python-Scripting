# MalwareDetector

This project introduces a user-friendly malware detection application built with Python's tkinter library. The application provides a GUI for file uploading and analysis, using SHA256 hash values and real-time queries to the MalwareBazaar API. Users receive immediate feedback on the security status of their files, classified as "Malware," "Not Malware," or "Could be a Malware."


## Features

- Drag-and-drop file upload
- File browsing
- Real-time malware scanning
- User-friendly interface


## Requirements

Install the required libraries :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

<ol>
